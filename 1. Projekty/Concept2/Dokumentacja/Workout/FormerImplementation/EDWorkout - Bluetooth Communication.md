-   `results`: `Result<EDPMWorkoutResults, Error>` - the workout results received from the PM device

### Details
1.  If the results are successfully received, call the `handle(workoutResults:)` function passing in the received `results`. The function logs a debug message indicating the type of workout results received and sets the `isWaitingForResultsResponse` flag to false. If `shouldGetResultsFromMemoryLog` is true, it adds a workout breadcrumb indicating that memory log results have been received, logs a workout event indicating success in reading the PM logbook, and updates the workout with the received results from the memory log. Otherwise, it adds a workout breadcrumb indicating that BLE results have been received, logs a workout event indicating success in assembling raw workout data, and stores the results in `bleInterfaceResults`.
2.  Call the `syncOrRetryGettingResults()` function, which determines if the workout results are ready to be synced and saved. If so, it calls the `saveAndSyncWorkout()` function to save and sync the results. Otherwise, it sets the `shouldGetResultsFromMemoryLog` flag to true and stops the workout to retry calling for memory log results.
3.  If there is an error in receiving the results, add a workout breadcrumb with the error message to the analytics, log a workout event, and return.
4.  If the results are completed with Memory Log data, add a workout breadcrumb for receiving Memory Log results to the analytics, log a workout event for reading Memory Log data success, and update the workout with the received `results` by calling the `updateWorkout(with:source:)` function with `source` set to `.memoryLog`.
5.  If the results are not completed with Memory Log data, add a workout breadcrumb for receiving BLE results to the analytics, log a workout event for assembling workout raw data success, and set the `bleInterfaceResults` variable to the received `results`.
6.  If the results are ready to be synced, call the `saveAndSyncWorkout()` function to save and sync the workout.
7.  If the results are not ready to be synced, set the `shouldGetResultsFromMemoryLog` variable to `true`, and call the `stopWorkout()` function to stop the workout and attempt to call for Memory Log results.
